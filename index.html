                <p>
                Hello! I am a 4th year student at UCSD majoring in Computer Engineering. I'm passionate about working with others
                to develop client-focused solutions, with a particular focus on performance optimizations. My favorite languages are Java and 
                C++. I'm always eager to learn more and constantly looking to improve my skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                Some hobbies of mine include swimming, playing the guitar, tutoring, and learning about things that randomly pique my interest,
                like emerging hardware technologies or game theory.
                </p>

                <h2 id="project1header">Social Compass</h2>
                <p id="project1">
                As a group of six, I helped develop a social compass android app using JavaScript. The app allowed users to add their friends or family on the app, letting them
                see each other on the app on a compass with cardinal directions that moved along with the phone's gyroscope. The app also let them see how far they were from one another.
                I primarily contributed to the backend algorithms for calculating the distance between the user and landmarks or other people, as well as pulling their locations 
                from a shared server. I also helped to determine where the visuals representing these people on the screen depending on their relative distances should land.

                <h2 id="project2header">Barter Assistant</h2>
                <p id="project2">
                In a game I frequently play called Black Desert Online, there is a complex bartering system in which you can travel to various places and trade items with 
                the goal of making profit in the game. Within this system there are many limitations, such as physical distance, obstacles, and limitations on individual trades. 
                To alleviate this, I designed a script in Python that made use of multiple algorithms I designed and implemented myself to tell the user the items they needed 
                to stock, the order of the places in which they should travel, and the amounts they needed to trade to make the most sustained income in the least amount of time.

                <h2 id="project3header">Original CPU Architecture</h2>
                <p id="project3">
                My two friends and I were tasked with developing an entirely unique CPU architecture, which included specifying our own ISA, designing the 
                SystemVerilog modules to support those instructions, and writing a Python-based compiler to convert our assembly to machine code. Designed under a 9-bit instruction
                limit, we heavily refactored and optimized our architecture to perform three specific tasks with our CPU: encrypting of a message using parity bits, decrypting messages
                of the same format using forward-error correction, and checking if a string is contained in a larger string.
